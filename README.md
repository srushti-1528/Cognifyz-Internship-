## Problem Statement

### Level 1 : 

**Task 1 : Data Exploration and Preprocessing**

    - Explore the dataset and identify the number of rows and columns.  
    - Check for missing values in each column and handle them accordingly.    
    - Perform data type conversion if necessary. Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances.
    
    
**Task 2 : Descriptive Analysis**

    - Calculate basic statistical measures (mean,median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.   
    - Explore the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and"Cuisines." Identify the top 
      cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.
    
    
**Task 3 : Geospatial Analysis**

    - Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information.   
    - Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries. Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.

### Level 2 : 

**Task 1 : Table Booking and Online Delivery**

    - Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.  
    - Compare the average ratings of restaurants with table booking and those without.  
    - Analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.
    
    
**Task 2 : Price Range Analysis**

    - Determine the most common price range among all the restaurants.  
    - Calculate the average rating for each price range & Identify the color that represents the highest average rating 
    among different price ranges.
    
    
**Task 3 : Feature Engineering**

    - Extract additional features from the existing columns, such as the length of the restaurant name or address.
    - Create new features like "Has Table Booking"or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.

### Level 3 : 

**Task 1 : Predictive Modeling**

    - Build a regression model to predict theaggregate rating of a restaurant based onavailable features.
      Split the dataset into training and testing setsand evaluate the model's performance usingappropriate metrics.
    - Experiment with different algorithms (e.g.,linear regression, decision trees, randomforest) and compare their performance.
    
    
**Task 2 : Customer Preference Analysis**

    - Analyze the relationship between the type ofcuisine and the restaurant's rating.
    - Identify the most popular cuisines amongcustomers based on the number of votes.
    - Determine if there are any specific cuisinesthat tend to receive higher ratings.
    
**Task 3 : Data Visualization**

    - Create visualizations to represent the distributionof ratings using different charts (histogram, barplot, etc.).
    - Compare the average ratings of different cuisinesor cities using appropriate visualizations.
    - Visualize the relationship between variousfeatures and the target variable to gain insights.
